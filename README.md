Payeasy is a responsive reactJS web application that is designed primarily to showcase my frontend skills in create beautiful and responsive user interfaces to a potential employer.

# What it does

The features implemented in this app were specified by the examiners. It is a dynamic web application that is responsive to different devices view ports. No API was fetched in this app.

An improvement on this version of the application will be to consume APIs and design pages on other routes. This was not part of the assessment. Hence it was left out.

# Frameworks and Libraries used

The following frameworks were used for faster development of the web application:

- ReactJs
- React-router-dom v6
- ESLint
- Prettier
- BootStrap5

# Challenges I faced

I had about 52 hours to turn-in this app. So I had little time to put in my artistic skills as a frontend developer. Although challenging due to time constraints, I still found this exercise interesting.

# How to install and run the web application locally on your machine

To run the app locally, please follow the steps below:

1. Git clone the repository on your terminal:
   git clone https://github.com/duokobia/payeazy.git

4. npm start

That is it! The application should run on your local server on http://localhost:3000.
